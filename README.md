pyshull
=======

pyshull.py : S-Hull Delaunay triangulation implemented in pure Python. Based on S-hull: a fast sweep-hull routine for Delaunay triangulation by David Sinclair. This implementation is 10-100 times slower than the reported results of S-HULL implemented in C.

earclipping.py : Based on Triangulation by Ear Clipping by David Eberly. Triangularisation of a simple polygon (no self intersections) with holes.

Tested on Python 2.7 and 3.4
